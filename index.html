            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I love to think about my job , sharing my concept and eat food. My true passion is others discover their
                love of cooking. Like most of you, I am not formally trained in the culinary.I'm far from being a Chef,
                but I feel confident in my cooking skills and I know that you can feel the
                same way.

            “I hate the nation of a secret recipe. Recipes are by nature derivative and 
            meant to be shared - that is how they improve, are changed, how new ideas 
            are formed. To stop a recipe in it's tracks, to label it "secret" just 
            seems mean.”

                <p>
                    The word vegetable is more of a culinary (cooking) term, though. We separate fruits and vegetables
                    mainly because fruits are usually sweet or sour, while vegetables are often blander (not full of
                    flavor) and are used in savory (not sweet) recipes.

                <h3>Testy Soup</h3>
                <p>
                    I adore soup. I love making it, I love eating it, and I love packing up the leftovers so that I can
                    enjoy it again the next day. When I’m stressed, I turn to soup because I find it meditative to cook.
                    When I’m snowed in, I turn to it because I keep a stash stored away in my freezer.

                <p>
                    This is one of the more famous sandwiches straight out of the island of Cuba. This recipe came from
                    my uncle who used to work at a restaurant in Pinar del Rio, Cuba and now works at a Cuban cafeteria
                    here in Miami.
